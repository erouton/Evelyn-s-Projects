[100 points] Suppose you are given a relation emp(empid, dept, salary) and wish to maintain a materialized view deptsalary(dept, totalsalary) 
which stores the total salary for all employees of each department. Suppose the system does not support materialized views but supports triggers. 
Write an SQL trigger on insert on emp to keep the relation deptsalary up to date. Do not worry about deletes or updates. Assume that there is 
already a tuple for each department in deptsalary so you do not need to worry about new departments.

Please note that, this question asks to use SQL syntax to create a trigger. Do not use Oracle's or PostgrSQL's syntax or that of any specific DBMS for this question.  




create trigger total_salary after insert on emp
referencing new row as nrow
for each row
begin 
    UPDATE deptsalary
    SET totalsalary = totalsalary + nrow.salary
    WHERE dept = nrow.dept;
end;
