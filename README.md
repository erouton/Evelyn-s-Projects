Course Descriptions: https://www.missouristate.edu/Registrar/Catalog/courses_cs.asp

CSC130 - The World of Computer Science - Completed FA22
"An introduction to programming and computer science. 
Topics will include data representation, algorithm design, 
and software development. Students will learn a high level 
language and use it to write programs. Suitable for non-majors 
who want to learn about programming and computer science. "

CSC131- Computational Thinking - Completed SP23
"Solving problems using computation and implementing solutions 
in a high-level programming language with emphasis on higher 
order functions, recursion, object-oriented programming and GUI 
development. The course continues with Python from CSC 130 before 
transitioning to C++. The basic constructs of C++ including data 
types, I/O, control statements, arrays, and pointers are covered."

CSC232 - Data Structures - Completed FA23
"A continuation of CSC 131. Topics will include: algorithm design; 
complexity analysis; abstract data types and encapsulation; basic 
data structures and their application, including stacks, queues, 
linked lists and binary trees; dynamic memory allocation; recursion; 
sorting and searching; debugging techniques."

CSC325 - Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures SP24
"A study of algorithms and advanced data structures including 
graphs, heaps, hashing, self-adjusting data structures, set 
representations, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming and 
introduction to NP-complete problems. The course emphasizes on 
the study of efficiency and algorithm analysis. "

CSC335 - Database Systems FA24
"A study of modern database systems and their underlying concepts. 
Core topics include the relational model, SQL, database design theory, 
query processing, file structures, transactions, and concurrency. 
Programming projects provide practical experience in developing GUI 
database applications."

CSC360 - Operating Systems FA24
"Introduction to operating systems concepts, principles, and design. 
Topics include: processes, threads, CPU scheduling, mutual exclusion, 
process synchronization, deadlocks, memory management, file systems, 
i/o systems, disk management, distributed systems, security and protection."
