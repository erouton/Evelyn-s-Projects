Course Descriptions: https://www.missouristate.edu/Registrar/Catalog/courses_cs.asp

CSC130 - The World of Computer Science - Completed FA22
"An introduction to programming and computer science. 
Topics will include data representation, algorithm design, 
and software development. Students will learn a high level 
language and use it to write programs. Suitable for non-majors 
who want to learn about programming and computer science. "

CSC131- Computational Thinking - Completed SP22
"Solving problems using computation and implementing solutions 
in a high-level programming language with emphasis on higher 
order functions, recursion, object-oriented programming and GUI 
development. The course continues with Python from CSC 130 before 
transitioning to C++. The basic constructs of C++ including data 
types, I/O, control statements, arrays, and pointers are covered."

CSC232 - Data Structures - Completed FA23
"A continuation of CSC 131. Topics will include: algorithm design; 
complexity analysis; abstract data types and encapsulation; basic 
data structures and their application, including stacks, queues, 
linked lists and binary trees; dynamic memory allocation; recursion; 
sorting and searching; debugging techniques."

CSC325 - Algorithms and Advanced Data Structures
"A study of algorithms and advanced data structures including 
graphs, heaps, hashing, self-adjusting data structures, set 
representations, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming and 
introduction to NP-complete problems. The course emphasizes on 
the study of efficiency and algorithm analysis. "
